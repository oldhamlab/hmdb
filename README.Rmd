- `hmdb_proteins`: A list of metabolites and protein associations. Metabolites 
without known protein associations were excluded. Proteins without HGNC symbols 
were also excluded.

## Data Use

From https://hmdb.ca/about: 

HMDB is offered to the public as a freely available resource. Use and 
re-distribution of the data, in whole or in part, for commercial purposes 
requires explicit permission of the authors and explicit acknowledgment of the 
source material (HMDB) and the original publication (see below). We ask that 
users who download significant portions of the database cite the HMDB paper in 
any resulting publications.
